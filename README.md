Chatbots are creeping slowly into even the most boring of business interactions. They already started to rule over the low stakes mass market, over simplifying your everyday tasks. From ordering food or query your laptop service to even your credit card queries. 

A chatbot is an artificial intelligence (AI) software that can simulate a conversation (or a chat) with a user in natural language 
 through messaging applications, websites, mobile apps or through the telephone.
  
 Railway services are available in most of the countries in the world. However, the demand for fast, reliable, and passenger friendly services is always being felt. With the ever increasing passenger and freight loads, more efficient mechanisms are needed to handle this increasing demand. And this would not be of only man-power but of smart technologies which when induced within the system, would produce a smarter railway system throughout.

 Indian Railway, the largest employer in India and one of the slowest service providers in terms of train inquiries and ticket booking, may choose the chatbot route for faster response.The inclusion of AI technology via chatbot in customer service is the need of the hour and the world of smartphones and smart devices can help the country to adopt it quickly.Not only for Indian Railways ,many countries need to adapt AI to maintain a good user engagement system..
